# Click Probability Predictor

## Team: Data Queens
This project predicts the probability of a click for a given set of user session data using a trained machine learning model.

## Overview
The Click Probability Predictor app is built with Streamlit to allow users to upload a CSV file containing session data. The app processes the data and generates predictions for the likelihood of a click (is_click = 1) based on various features such as user_id, product, campaign_id, and more.
